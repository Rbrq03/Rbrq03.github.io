Hi, I am Jiannan Huang, a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU).

<!-- My research interests include a wide range of Machine Learning and Multi-modal AI areas. Currently, I am focusing on the following specific topics:

- **Generative Model and its controllability**: Controllable Text-to-Image/Video Generation, Image/Video Editing, Image/Video Personalization.
- **Multimodal Understanding & Generation**: Development and Application of Large-scale Multi-modal models.
- **Multimodal Agents**: Establishment of Multimodal Agents for real-world application. -->

My research interests include diverse topics of Multi-modal AI and Generative Models like:

- **Mutli-modal Generation**: Aim at generating image/video with multi-modal/spatial conditions.
- **Efficient Diffusion Training**: Aim at reducing budget of training a diffusion model from scratch.
- **Agent for Computer Vision**: Aim at developing agents for fundamental computer vision problems.

<!-- During my undergraduate research experience, I had the privilege of studying and working at the [Wei Lab](https://weiyc.github.io) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io)), [Knowledge Engineering Group](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](http://tsinghua.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/)), and [SHI Labs](https://www.shi-labs.com/) at [Georgia Tech](https://ic.gatech.edu/) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Humphery Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/)) -->

I am open to any collaboration on topics with which I am familiar. If you would like to collaborate with me, have any questions or just chat, feel free to send me an email.
