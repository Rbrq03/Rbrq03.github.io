Hi, I am Jiannan Huang, a second year undergraduate student at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)

I like self-taught computer science, I highly recommand you to learn course in this [list](https://rbrq03.github.io/blog/2023/custom-blockquotes/) if you want to get start or dive into corresponding area.

My research interest includes machine learning, and multi-model areas. Currently, I am interest on equipping LLMs with multi-model ability and large multi-model models.

During my undergraduate research experience, I had the privilege of interning at the [Wei Lab](https://weiyc.github.io) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn)(Major Mentor:Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io)), and [Knowledge Engineering Group](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](http://tsinghua.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/))
