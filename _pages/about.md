Hi, I am Jiannan Huang, a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU).

I like self-taught computer science, and I highly recommend exploring the courses listed in this [page](https://rbrq03.github.io/blog/2023/self-taught/) if you're interested in getting started or diving into specific areas.

My research interests include a wide range of areas in Machine Learning and Multi-modal AI. Currently, I am focusing on following specific topics:

* Generative Model and its controllability: Controllable Text-to-Image/Video Generation, Image/Video Editing,
* Multimodal Agents: Establishment of Multimodal Agents
* Multimodal Understanding: Development and Application of Large-scale Multi-modal models.

During my undergraduate research experience, I had the privilege of interning at the [Wei Lab](https://weiyc.github.io) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn)(Major Mentor:Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io)), and [Knowledge Engineering Group](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](http://tsinghua.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/))

If you would like to collaborate with me or have any questions about me, please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:jiannan2003@gmail.com)
