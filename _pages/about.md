Hi, I am Jiannan Huang, a first-year graduate student majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Humphery Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University. During my undergradute, I had the privilege of being supervisied by Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io).

<!-- My research interests include a wide range of Machine Learning and Multi-modal AI areas. Currently, I am focusing on the following specific topics:

- **Generative Model and its controllability**: Controllable Text-to-Image/Video Generation, Image/Video Editing, Image/Video Personalization.
- **Multimodal Understanding & Generation**: Development and Application of Large-scale Multi-modal models.
- **Multimodal Agents**: Establishment of Multimodal Agents for real-world application. -->



Human intelligence and reasoning are not limited to text, but arise from coordinated multimodal thinking. My long-term goal is to build robust, high-performing multimodal reasoning systems that enable stronger intelligence and content generation. My research interest lies in data synthesis, evaluation, model/agentic system design, and training for such multimodal system.

<!-- During my undergraduate research experience, I had the privilege of studying and working at the [Wei Lab](https://weiyc.github.io) at [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Yunchao Wei](https://weiyc.github.io)), [Knowledge Engineering Group](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](http://tsinghua.edu.cn) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/)), and [SHI Labs](https://www.shi-labs.com/) at [Georgia Tech](https://ic.gatech.edu/) (Major Mentor: Prof. [Humphery Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/)) -->

I am open to any collaboration on topics with which I am familiar. If you would like to collaborate with me or just chat, feel free to send me an email.
