**TL;DR;**

The following is a list of courses and clerks that I have studied and highly recommend others to study:

1. **For newbie**:

   - [MIT Missing-semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/): For some basic tools such as git, shell, tmux...
   - [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org): Learn git in game mode
   - [UCB CS61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su20/): You will get idea of "coding" in this course.

2. **Algorithms and Data Structre**:
   - [UCB CS61B](https://sp18.datastructur.es/): Excellent Algorithms and Data Structre course.
   - [UCB CS170](https://cs170.org/): Harder version.
3. **Software Construction**

   - [MIT 6.031](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/): Coding, coding and coding... But I love it!

4. **Deep Learning**
   - [Dive into Deep Learning](): Learn Deep Learning while practing.
   - [CS231n](): A hardcore but excellent computer vision course.

<!-- 1. **Book**: Dive into deep Learning
1. **CMU**: CSAPP
2. **MIT**: 6.031-Software Construction, Missing-semester
3. **Standford**: CS231n
4. **UCB**: CS61a, CS61b, CS170 -->

### Why this page

During my undergraduate years, I found that the courses from renowned universities around the world played a pivotal role in my personal growth. Some of them deepened my understanding of specific fields, while others enhanced my coding skills. Certain courses challenged and sharpened my thinking abilities, and a few even introduced me to the world of research in areas that genuinely interest me. Moreover, the period during which I worked hard in these courses made me more self-motivated.

In all the courses I have taken, I find some to be truly excellent. Therefore, I highly recommend anyone who is new to Computer Science (whether they are freshmen or anyone interested in gaining some knowledge of Computer Science) to learn the following courses.

If you cannot find a suitable course for yourself in the following list, you can check out [csdiy](https://csdiy.wiki), a website that gathers numerous computer science courses. It was established by a student from Peking University, and I have personally gained a lot from this website as well.

Finally, I would like to express my respect to the professors who teach these courses and make them open-access. Their efforts have enabled people from all around the world to access equal and high-quality education.

Let's start!

### Course List

#### For newbie

- **MIT Missing Semester**
  While working on my first project, I find various tools that I don't know before such as git, shell. No one taught me how to use them, assuming I was already proficient. This course taught me how to use these tools. I highly recommend taking this course immediately after or even during learning your first programming language.
